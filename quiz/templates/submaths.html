                                    <p>The International School Mathematics Olympiad (ISMO) is an international competitive exam for students ranging from class 1 to 12. The exam pattern will follow mock tests and one final exam. 
                                        The Mock Tests can be given three times after which the candidate must appear for the final exam.
                                        The total time given for the examination is    for classes 1 and     for classes 2 to 12.
                                        The exam follows the multiple choice question pattern.
                                        Unlike the tests at local and regional levels, ISMO provides a stronger grasp of topics and applications.
                                        Once the exam is completed, an extensive report of the student’s performance will be provided which can help him/her get to know his/her strengths and weaknesses.
                                        The website offers a section for exam preparation where you can get tips, guidance and book recommendations.

                                      The exam will be divided into sections as follows: <br><br>
